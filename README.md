# Clone-Invasion-C64
Copy of Planet Invasion by the Harlow Cracking Service

There's an ACME assembled clone_invasion.prg included which should work on any PAL C64 or C128 and a compressed version called clone_invasion_exo.prg which is Exomised. The build.bat will, if those tools are both present, assemble and crunch the demo.
